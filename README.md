# Dual-N Back

Dual-N Back is a cognitive training game that stresses your working memory through two feedback stimuli: visual and audio. 

Players are presented with a 3x3 square grid. Each turn, a square flashes while playing an alphabetical letter. The goal of the player is to identify whether
this exact square and/or sound was played N turns ago. 

The concept of the game was first introduced by Susan Jaeggi et al. in a [2008 PNAS study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0801268105). Their intent was to explore whether fluid intelligence could be trained through the rigorous activity
of Dual N-Back. Since then, several papers have been published with both supporting and conflicting results. 

More recently, a few [papers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25867501/) have claimed its potential in preventing age-related cognitive decline.

Although unproven, the game remains a promising area of research.
